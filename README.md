A GUI interface using jbaiter's pyomxplayer wrapper to control omxplayer, with youtube-dl integration and support for lyrics

INSTALLATION
============

Instructions for installation on the official Raspbian image (should work on Ubuntu too):

You can use the automatic installer, or if that does not work for some reason you can install it manually.

To download and run the installer, from a terminal window, type (or copy-paste):

        cd ~ && wget https://github.com/KenT2/tboplayer/tarball/master -O - | tar xz &&
        cd KenT2-tboplayer-* && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
	
After that, TBOPlayer will have been installed on your system. To run it, just type 'tboplayer', or use the shortcut created in your Desktop.

If you prefer to install it manually, do as follows:
	
Update omxplayer
-----------------------------

Ensure you have the latest version of omxplayer by typing the following in a terminal window:

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade -y omxplayer

Install dependencies
-----------------------------

Type this into the terminal to install TBOPlayer's dependencies:

        # install pip, gobject, dbus, tk, gtk, requests, avconv, tkdnd
        sudo apt-get install -y python-pip python-gobject-2 python-dbus python-tk python-gtk2 python-requests libav-tools tkdnd
        # install pexpect, ptyprocess, magic
        yes | pip install --user pexpect ptyprocess python-magic
        # install youtube-dl
        sudo wget https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -O /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
        sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
        # or update youtube-dl
        sudo youtube-dl -U

Download and Install TBOPlayer
------------------------------

From a terminal window, type:

        cd ~ && wget https://github.com/KenT2/tboplayer/tarball/master -O - | tar xz

Move the resulting directory to /opt:

        sudo mv KenT2-tboplayer-* /opt/tboplayer

To run TBOPlayer, type in a terminal window:

        python /opt/tboplayer/tboplayer.py

TBOPlayer is developed on Raspbian Wheezy with python 2.7

    * Download actual media URL [when] - defines when to extract the actual media from the given URL, either upon adding the URL or when playing it
    
    * Youtube media quality - lets you choose among "small", "medium" and "high" qualities (Youtube only feature)

    * Autoplay at start up - if TBOPlayer has just been opened and has some file in the playlist, automatically start playing the first file in the list

    * Keep youtube-dl up-to-date - upon start, check if there is a newer version of youtube-dl, and if there is, install it
    
    * Forbid windowed mode - if enabled will make videos always show in full screen, disabling the video window mode and video progress bar - may be useful if you're using tboplayer through a remote desktop
    
    * Find lyrics - if enabled, TBOPlayer will try to fetch lyrics for playing track - defaults to off - more details below 
	
    * Debug - prints some debug text to the command line/log file (requires you to close and restart tboplayer)

If you used the automatic installer, you should be able to open files with double-click, or with the right mouse click menu in your file manager.

A track is selected using a single click of the mouse or up-down arrow key, playing is started by pressing the Play/Pause button, the . key or the Return key.

Removing the selected track can be done by pressing the Delete key.

During playing of a track, a clickable progress bar will appear below the playlist, which lets you seek a position, and if playing a video it's possible to see the progress bar if you move your mouse to the lowest side of the video.

Again during playing of a track, a slightly modified set of omxplayer commands can be used from the keyboard but there must be FOCUS on TBOPlayer. A list of commands is provided in the help menu. Note: some of the commands are not implemented by omxplayer. 

While playing videos, you can hit the F11 key for toggling full screen mode. In windowed mode, to move the video window, click and hold the first mouse button over the video area and then move the mouse; and to resize the video, hold left Control, click and hold the first mouse button over the video area and then move the mouse.

For a list of streaming services supported by youtube-dl, see this link: https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html (not all of them were tested with TBOPlayer/OMXplayer).

If the option 'Find lyrics' is enabled, TBOPlayer will look for the metatags 'artist' and 'title' in the media file, and if such tags are not found, it will try to find this info in a pattern in the file name (or in the track title for web links), something along the forms 'Artist Name - Song Title' or 'Artist Name : Song Title', in order to grab the lyrics from [LyricWikia](http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Lyrics_Wiki) webservice.

DBus Interface

TROUBLESHOOTING
=========

If you have problems playing a track try it from the command line with `omxplayer -o hdmi filename` or `omxplayer -o local filename` to make sure it's not a problem with omxplayer.

If the progress bar, volume bar, or windowed video mode don't work for you, it may be that you have another instance of omxplayer running in the background. In that case, you can try to close that instance, and then play the track again. You can force omxplayer to terminate by typing in a terminal: `sudo pkill -9 omxplayer`

If the videos appear displaced by an amount of pixels, you must be having overscan problems. To disable overscan go to Menu>Preferences>Raspberry Pi Configuration and then set Overscan to Disabled.

With TBOPlayer, the youtube-dl binary should always be up-to-date, but if you keep getting a lot of "Content may be copyrighted or the link invalid" when trying to play videos from streaming services supported by youtube-dl, you can try to update youtube-dl by typing in a terminal: `sudo youtube-dl -U`

NOTE: Since OMXPlayer deprecation was annouced, TBOPlayer for Python 3 was dumped in favor of the one for Python 2, for the maintainers considered not worth investing much in the Python 3 version. The Python 2 version should still be maintained though.
